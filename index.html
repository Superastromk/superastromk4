  <h1> The Sixth Grade Syntax Site </h1>
<h2> By Mridul K, Massa J, Sai T, and Kien P(6Fe)</h2>
<h3> What is Syntax? </h3>
<p> - Syntax (in a linguistic sense) is the way words or phrases go together in a language. </p>
<h3> What are the Parts of Syntax? </h3>
<p> The parts of syntax are:
  <li> Phrases (Noun, Adjective, Adverb, Verb, Prepositional)
    <li> Determiners
      <li> Clauses (relative, adverbial, coordinate)
        <li> Word Order
          <h3> Syntax in Other Fields </h3>
          <li> Math : Syntax is the part of mathematics that deals with symbols, and rules for manipulating them. 
            <li> Coding/Programming :  It refers to the rules and regulations for writing any statement in a programming language (like C / C++). 

​
          <h3> What is Word Order? </h3>
          <p> Word order, as it says in the name, is the order in which words go in a language. </p>
          <p> The word order for English, for example, is SVO, which means that the order of an English phrase will have a basic structure of subject, object, then verb. </p>
              <p> Word order in other languages include: </p>
              <li> Japanese: SOV
                <li> Arabic: SVO and VSO
                  <li> Russian: OVS

                    <h3> What are constituents? </h3>
                    
                    <p> A constituent is a word or group of words which function as a single unit, and pass at least one of the three constituency tests </p>
                    <p> The constituency tests are: </p>
                    <li> Replacement- phrase where you can replace it with the same part of speech and get a sentence with the same meaning.
                      <br>

E.g., The students saw a movie after class. --> The students saw it after class. 
                      <br>
                      <li> Movement- Some constituents can be moved to somewhere else in the sentence without changing the sentence’s meaning or its grammaticality. 
<br>
E.g., Jack bought a scarf at that strange shop. --> At that strange shop, Jack bought a scarf.
                        <br>
 <li> Cleft- Where you take two parts of a sentence and divide them from each other. 
<br>
E.g., The students saw a movie after class. --> It was a movie that the students saw after class.​
   <h2> The kinds of phrases </h2>
   <h3> What is a phrase? </h3>
   <p> A phrase is a word or group of words functioning as a unit. </p>
   <h3> What are the parts of a phrase? </h3>
   <p> Phrases consist of the head and it's complements. The head is what the phrase is named after. For example, if the head is "armadillo", then it is a noun phrase. The complement is necessary to convey and complete the information that is trying to be expressed with the phrase. <p>
   <h3> Noun Phrases </h3>
   <p>A noun phrase, or nominal (phrase), is a phrase that has a noun or pronoun as its head or performs the same grammatical function as a noun.</p>
     <br>
     Examples:
     <br>

The spotted puppy was up for adoption.​
     <br>

<li>The spotted puppy is the noun phrase, because it can be replaced with any noun(replacement test)​
<br>
Has anyone seen my striped cat?​
<br>
<li>This could become --> Everyone has seen my striped cat.​
  <h3> Verb Phrases </h3>
  <p> The part of a sentence containing the verb and any direct or indirect object, but not the subject. </p>
  <br>
  Examples:
  <br>

She was walking quickly to her house​
  <br>

<li>Was walking quickly can be replaced by running(verb). Which is an example of replacement test. ​
<br>
He ate the food. ​
<br>
<li>Ate can be moved --> The food he ate.​
  <h3> Adverb Phrases </h3>
  <p> A group of words that acts like an adverb—i.e., it modifies a verb, adjective, adverb, or even a whole clause. 
<br>
    Like adverbs, adverbial phrases can be used to describe how, where, when, and why.</p>
    <br>
    Examples:
    <br>
    She ate her breakfast very quickly.​

<li> Very quickly could be moved to the front --> Very quickly, she ate her breakfast. ​

  <h3> Prepositional phrases </h3>
  <p> A prepositional phrase is a phrase which has it's head as a preposition.  In other words, a prepositional phrase is a group of words consisting of a preposition, its object, and any words that modify the object.</p>
    <br>
    Examples:
    <br>
    She hid under the table.
    <li> "under the table" is the prepositional phrase in this case, and can be moved to become "Under the table, she hid."
      <h3> Adjective Phrases </h3>
      <p> An adjective phrase, or adjectival phrase, is a group of words that include an adjective that modifies (changes) a noun or pronoun. </p>
      <br>
      Examples:
      <br>
      Someone smarter than me has to explain this.
      <li> In this case, "smarter than me" is the adjective phrase. This can be moved to "To explain this, someone has to be smarter than me."
        <h2> Syntax Trees </h2>
        <p> A syntax tree is a representation of the structure of a single sentence – of the way that the individual words are grouped into phrases and eventually form the full sentence. </p>
        <h3> Steps to make a syntax tree </h3> 
        <li> 1. Start by identifying each word's part of speech 
          <li> 2. Identify phrases and constituents
            <li> 3.
